# I finally work this out!

**This is my first Jekyll blog post.**

I began to learn HTML again a couple of weeks ago. 

This time I want to trace my learning activities openly,so I choose to use GitHub Pages and Jekyll to maintain a personal website. 

Following the official docs, I found it's very easy to set up a website.

However, the document may omit some details leaving me confused about how to add new post. 

After failing a few times, I finally find the right way through testing the website locally :)

So the lessons learned here

- To read/write the document carefully

- Be hands-on and get hands dirty
